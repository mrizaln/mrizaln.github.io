I have always liked Conway's Game of Life simulation. This very complex system arise from simple set
of rules fascinates me. This project allows me to create such simulation. I can directly modify the
cells state on the simulation so that I can create anything I want. For example, in the preview I
created a glider gun and a period-3 oscillator.
