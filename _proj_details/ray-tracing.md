Ray tracing has always been a mystery to me. Ever since I stumble upon it, I've always wanted to
learn more of this rendering technique. This project is my attempt at creating a ray tracer. I
followed [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) and implemented it in Rust just
because.
