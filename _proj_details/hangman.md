This project was my first endeavor into C++ programming. I created this project to learn the basics
of C++ programming. The project is a simple hangman game that is played in the console. The game is
very simple, the player has to guess the word by guessing the letters. The player has a limited
number of guesses before the game ends. The game has a simple ASCII art of the hangman that is drawn
as the player guesses the wrong letter.

The code was
[awful](https://github.com/mrizaln/hangman/blob/80798cb485d83074474bf2c330333b607efe164b/hangman.cpp),
so recently I decided to rewrite the code to be more modern and be more flexible by allowing custom
word list (by default it uses /usr/share/dict/words).
