This project is a collaborative project with my friends in Bangkit Academy as
the final project. The project is a meditation app that is designed to help
people meditate. This application integrates an AI (Machine Learning Model that
can infer emotion from text) to suggest the best meditation session for the user
(in the form of nature sounds). I, for the most part, is responsible for
integrating this feature locally (no cloud) while also working on other aspect
of the application UI logic (the UI design is done by my friend). The app is
written in Kotlin and uses Android Studio as the IDE.
