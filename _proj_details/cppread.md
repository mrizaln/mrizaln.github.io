Out of frustration of the C++ i/o system, I decided to create a simple library that allows me to
read input from the console easily. The library also has a built-in parser that can parse the input
into a specific type (int, float, string, etc) or you can create your own parser to parse the input
into a custom type or override an existing parser for a type. The main feature of the library aside
from the custom parsing is that it allows for easy input for multiple values (for example, for birth
date input in 'y/m/d' format).
