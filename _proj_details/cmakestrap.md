There are many project initializer script for C++ with CMake, the most famous one is cmake-init.
Unfortunately, it generates too much files for my liking. Looking at
[this issue](https://github.com/friendlyanon/cmake-init/issues/75), that has been up since 2023, it
seems that the author does not have the time to provide an option to generate a simpler, thinner,
project structure. This script is an attempt to provide that.
