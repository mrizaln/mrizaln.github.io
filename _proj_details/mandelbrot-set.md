Ever since I saw a video about Mandelbrot Set on Youtube, I've always wanted to make **my own**
renderer. This is my attempt. The rendering is done in the CPU so it's very slow even though I have
utilized multithreading.

The next attempt is rendering a [Julia Set](julia-set.html) but using GPU rendering technique which
is much much faster.
